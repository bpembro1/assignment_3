    <p> Dexter (top) was the first dog that we addopted. He is a momma's boy and is afraid of anything and everything</p> </div>
    <div> <h2> Polka Dotty</h2>
    <a href="Dotty.jpg"><img src="Dotty.jpg" alt=" Polka Dotty" height="200"></a>
    <p> When we got Dotty she was rescued from a home where she was being used as a breading dog. She now has a much happier life with her furry siblings! Her favorite passtimes include: Going for walks, laying in mud, and sleeping her cares away!</p> </div>
   <div> <h2>Hercules</h2>
    <a href="Herc.jpg"><img src="Herc.jpg" alt="Herc" height="200"></a>
    <p> Hercules is the new puppy, he is a sweet little block head who doesnt look before he leaps. He loves everything all the time, especially meeting new people or dogs.</p> </div>
